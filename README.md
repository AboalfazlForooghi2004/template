## 📝 Project Description

Cisco Auto Config Generator is a lightweight automation tool designed to generate Cisco device configurations using **Jinja2 templates** and **YAML data files**.
Instead of manually writing repetitive network settings (such as NTP configuration, hostname assignment, interface settings, and more), you can define your variables in a YAML file and let the script automatically produce a complete and consistent configuration.

This approach helps:

* Reduce manual configuration errors
* Speed up device provisioning
* Maintain standardized templates across networks
* Separate configuration logic (templates) from data (YAML)

The tool works for routers, switches, or any Cisco devices that support text-based configuration.
